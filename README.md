## FAQ (Minecraft)

### What is Trident?

Trident is many things. For some people, Trident is a collection of people who make things for block games. To most people, Trident is a server software which they use since Spigot and Paper don't meet their needs.

### Why isn't my non-latest version of Trident supported?
Trident will only update the latest versions of it's Minecraft API. Please note: **all** versions will receive bug fixes; however, only the latest version will receive updates considered non-essential.
With this, we also encourage plugin developers to only support their software for the latest version of Minecraft.
There are many reasons that we have decided to use this system: it is easier for the developers to maintain; all plugins and server-implementations are equipped with auto-updaters that make the lives of server owners much easier when updates are released.

### How can I donate?

Trident will not be accepting donations until the project is usable.
